# GPU NETWORK BOT

A Node.js-based Terminal User Interface (TUI) bot designed to automate tasks on the GPU Network platform. This tool allows efficient multi-wallet interactions with the GPU protocol, handling batch operations, token-based auth, and proxy support.

## Features

- **Automated GPU Network Tasks**: Streamlines interactions with GPU Network's services.
- **Multi-Wallet Token Input**: Works with multiple tokens entered through a file.
- **Batch Execution**: Runs GPU Network operations across several accounts in one go.
- **Proxy Support**: Adds privacy and load balancing by routing requests via proxies.
- **Customizable Loops**: Define how many cycles each token runs.
- **Real-Time TUI**: Live logs and status per token.

## Pre Requisites

Ensure Git, Node.js, and npm are installed:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git nodejs npm -y
```
